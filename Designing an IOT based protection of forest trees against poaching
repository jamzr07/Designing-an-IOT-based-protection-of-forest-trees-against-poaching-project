Title: Designing an IOT based protection of forest trees against poaching.

Problem statement:

   To implement a smart system for protecting the forest trees by using IOT technique. 
We are Building this system for helping forest officials in detecting and alerting 
so that proper actions could be taken. In this system, forest trees or private farming 
such as teak cultivation, sandal-wood farming has been saved and human guards have 
been minimized, thus keeping the area safe for long times. The main objective of the 
proposed system is cost-effective and safe surveillance of forests and farmlands.

Project Description:

* We are developing such a system which can be used to restrict smuggling.

* Every tree will be equipped with one small electronics unit which consists of Micro Controller, vibration Sensor, MEMS, GPS and IOT module.

* In big forest, each tree will be having sensor unit which is fitted on stem of tree will Communicate with their server unit.

* The communication between tree unit and server unit take place by using IOT module.

* Tree cutting will be detected by vibration sensors, sound sensor and MEMS.

* By using sound sensor we can predict the cutting tree. Once the tree will fallen the nearest tree will sense the sound of fallen trees and send the signal to server.

* Sensor values having some fixed threshold value, once the threshold value will matched to the current value it will send the alert through IOT.

* Due to nature disaster some trees may fallen. for that purpose we are using IOT module for continuous monitoring of trees.
Requirements:

HAEDWARE: Microcontroller, Vibration sensor, Sound sensor, Smoke sensor, MEMS, PIR sensor, IOT, Fire sensor.

SOFTWARE: Embedded C, Arduino IDE.
